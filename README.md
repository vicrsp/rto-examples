# Real-time Optimization

This repository provides examples on how to use the `rtotools` package to build and evaluate different kinds of RTO systems.

## Installation
Installing the rtotools package should be sufficient for running the examples:

```bash
pip install packages/rtotools-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

Note: not available in pypi yet!

## CCTA 2021
See the following notebook that was used to create the results displayed in the paper: `notebooks/MA_GaussianProcesses_CCTA_2021.ipynb`

If you you want to reproduce the results, create two databases using the script above and then run the file `scripts/magp_experiment.py`. Results might differ a bit due to the stochastic nature of the system.

Don't forget to adjust the file names in both the notebook and the script file. Don't hesitate to send me a message if you have any troubles.
